# TUTORIAL: ✨hello sparkles!✨

## Prerequisites

This application is written in the [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/).
Therefore to run this application you'll need Rust installed. If you do not already have Rust 
installed, I recommend using the [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/) Rust version manager to install it.

#### Run the Example

This tutorial will walk you through writing a very small web application using Sparkles. If you would
like to try running a pre-written example:

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. cd `sparkles`
3. In your terminal run:

  ```
  cargo run --examples hello-sparkles
  ```
4. Visit [http://0.0.0.0:7878](http://0.0.0.0:7878) in your browser.
5. You should see the message "✨Hello, Sparkles!✨"

## 1. Create a New Rust Project

## 2. Add Dependencies

## 3. Create and Run a Server

## 4. Add a Route

## 5. Use a Template
